Its foundation by the Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft in 1818, its edition by the same society until 1 888, its emancipation and consolidation under important and impressive editors like K. V. GOEBEL, O. RENNER and K. MOTHES is discussed. The FLORA has devoted itself to the complete range of botany, however with various emphasis on special branches at different times of its history. Beyond comparison to other journals the FLORA reflects the history of botany in the postlinnean period. The era as most important periodical of systematic botany was followed by periods when morphology and developmental botany, then plant physiology and genetics, and finally biochemical physiology had been emphasized. Besides the most actual fields the remaining ones however never missed place for performance. The consideration of various diverging branches of botany in connection with increasing sizes of the volumes as well as the finally not realizable separation into two sections required specialisation and concentration on selected topics in order to remain competitive nowadays. At present the FLORA promotes linkage of the different traditional fields of botany in connection with functional aspects including ecophysiology."}}}},"item":{"ids":"LC481","bib_id":"188 (1): 5-& APR 1993","reprint_contact":{"address_spec":{"@attributes":{"addr_no":"1"},"full_address":"UNIV REGENSBURG,INST BOT,LEHRSTUHL BOT,UNIV STR 31,W-8400 REGENSBURG,GERMANY","organizations":{"@attributes":{"count":"2"},"organization":["UNIV REGENSBURG","University of Regensburg"]},"street":"INST BOT, LEHRSTUHL BOT, UNIV STR 31","city":"REGENSBURG","country":"GERMANY","zip":"W-8400"},"names":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"name":{"@attributes":{"addr_no":"1","role":"author","seq_no":"1","reprint":"Y"},"display_name":"BRESINSKY, A","full_name":"BRESINSKY, A","wos_standard":"BRESINSKY, A","first_name":"A","last_name":"BRESINSKY"}}}}},"dynamic_data":{"citation_related":{"tc_list":{"silo_tc":{"@attributes":{"local_count":"1","coll_id":"WOS"}}}},"cluster_related":{"identifiers":{"identifier":{"@attributes":{"value":"0367-2530","type":"issn"}}}}}},{"@attributes":{"r_id_disclaimer":"ResearcherID data provided by Thomson Reuters"},"UID":"WOS:A1993LE28400012","static_data":{"summary":{"EWUID":{"WUID":{"@attributes":{"coll_id":"WOS"}},"edition":[{"@attributes":{"value":"WOS.ISTP"}},{"@attributes":{"value":"WOS.SCI"}},{"@attributes":{"value":"WOS.AHCI"}}]},"pub_info":{"@attributes":{"issue":"2","pubtype":"Journal","sortdate":"1993-04-01","has_abstract":"Y","coverdate":"APR-JUN 1993","pubmonth":"APR-JUN","vol":"112","pubyear":"1993"},"page":"141-149"},"titles":{"@attributes":{"count":"6"},"title":["BIOLOGISCHES ZENTRALBLATT","BIOL ZBL","Biol.

After his famous pedagogical and philosophical work Emile had been condemned and burnt, ROUSSEAU fled to Neuchatel which, at that time, belonged to Prussia. There he started to study botany thoroughly reading works of important botanists like BUFFON, CARL VON LINNE, ALBRECHT VON HALLER, JEAN-ANTOINE D'IVERNOIS. During his stay in England he became acquainted with the Duchess of Portland whose botanic gardens became known all over Europe. Back to Paris, he started writing his ,Elementary Letters on Botany'' to Madame MADELEINE-CATHERINE DELESSERT, a young lady in Lyon. The letters 1 to 7 deal with the structure and 7 different families of plants, letter 8 giving instructions on how to make a herbal.","The aim of this study is not to find out whether ROUSSEAU was a good or a bad botanist, but to put ROUSSEAU in the context of the evolution of epistemological thinking in the 18th century (according to MICHEL FOUCAULT'S ''Les mots et les choses''). In a period where the rationality of life was being discovered, where people started to ''invest'' money or feelings in an earth which had been neglected hitherto, ROUSSEAU invested his feelings on behalf of the earth in his botanic research. But, for RouSSEAU, botany meant much more than science: to him it was kind of a therapy which comforted him in the last, very difficult years of his life.","Even if many aspects of the botanic work of ROUSSEAU are now out of date, his works (not only the Letters, but also his Dictionary on Botany and some parts of his Confessions and Promenades) still teach us valuable things on botany: how to learn to see, how to teach botany in a fascinating way. His observations on comparative morphology, on the structure of the flower, on herbals, on the history of botany, on the importance of preserving our natural environment, are still extremely important for our time."]}}}},"item":{"ids":"LE284","bib_id":"112 (2): 141-149 APR-JUN 1993"}},"dynamic_data":{"citation_related":{"tc_list":{"silo_tc":{"@attributes":{"local_count":"0","coll_id":"WOS"}}}},"cluster_related":{"identifiers":{"identifier":{"@attributes":{"value":"0006-3304","type":"issn"}}}}}},{"@attributes":{"r_id_disclaimer":"ResearcherID data provided by Thomson Reuters"},"UID":"WOS:000340452200001","static_data":{"summary":{"EWUID":{"WUID":{"@attributes":{"coll_id":"WOS"}},"edition":{"@attributes":{"value":"WOS.SCI"}}},"pub_info":{"@attributes":{"issue":"3","pubtype":"Journal","sortdate":"2014-03-01","has_abstract":"Y","coverdate":"MAR 2014","pubmonth":"MAR","vol":"101","pubyear":"2014"},"page":"389-397"},"titles":{"@attributes":{"count":"6"},"title":["AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","AM J BOT","Am.

It proposes a focus on the textbooks written by the German botanist Ludwig Reichenbach and his first attempt to use Goethe's idea of metamorphosis of plants as fundamental to his natural system of plants published under the title 'Botany for Women', in German Botanik fur Damen (1828). In this book, Reichenbach paid particular attention to Goethe's sensitive views on the essence of nature; he regarded Goethe's idea of metamorphosis in the plant kingdom as an ideal model to interpret connections of natural phenomena, in particular as a conceptual frame for a natural system. Furthermore, he aimed to develop the philosophical statement of the metamorphosis, in which he called for nature-philosophical conceptions in order to materialize his representation of plant \"affinities,\" and of a kind of \"ontogeny\" of the whole plant kingdom. This paper demonstrates that, between speculative views and empirical attempts, the extent to which Reichenbach actually belonged to a new \"school\" of thought, which left its mark on the history and philosophy of botany."}}}},"item":{"ids":"782XU","bib_id":"44 (2): 283-304 MAY 2011","bib_pagecount":"200","reprint_contact":{"address_spec":{"@attributes":{"addr_no":"1"},"full_address":"Leiden Univ, Scaliger Inst, POB 9501, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands","organizations":{"@attributes":{"count":"2"},"organization":["Leiden Univ","Leiden University"]},"suborganizations":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"suborganization":"Scaliger Inst"},"street":"POB 9501","city":"Leiden","country":"Netherlands","zip":"NL-2300 RA"},"names":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"name":{"@attributes":{"seq_no":"1","addr_no":"1","role":"author","reprint":"Y"},"display_name":"Robin, Nicolas","full_name":"Robin, Nicolas","wos_standard":"Robin, N","first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Robin","email_addr":"n.f.g.robin@hum.leidenuniv.nl"}}}}},"dynamic_data":{"citation_related":{"tc_list":{"silo_tc":{"@attributes":{"local_count":"0","coll_id":"WOS"}}}},"cluster_related":{"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"@attributes":{"value":"0022-5010","type":"issn"}},{"@attributes":{"value":"10.1007\/s10739-010-9231-y","type":"doi"}}]}}}},{"@attributes":{"r_id_disclaimer":"ResearcherID data provided by Thomson Reuters"},"UID":"WOS:A1992JR22700001","static_data":{"summary":{"EWUID":{"WUID":{"@attributes":{"coll_id":"WOS"}},"edition":{"@attributes":{"value":"WOS.SCI"}}},"pub_info":{"@attributes":{"issue":"3","pubtype":"Journal","sortdate":"1992-07-01","has_abstract":"Y","coverdate":"JUL-SEP 1992","pubmonth":"JUL-SEP","vol":"44","pubyear":"1992"},"page":"273-279"},"titles":{"@attributes":{"count":"6"},"title":["BRITTONIA","BRITTONIA","Brittonia","BRITTONIA","BRITTONIA","RUSBY,HENRY,HURD - THE FATHER OF ECONOMIC BOTANY AT THE NEW-YORK-BOTANICAL-GARDEN"]},"names":{"@attributes":{"count":"2"},"name":[{"@attributes":{"role":"author","seq_no":"1","reprint":"Y"},"display_name":"WILLIAMS, DE","full_name":"WILLIAMS, DE","wos_standard":"WILLIAMS, DE","first_name":"DE","last_name":"WILLIAMS"},{"@attributes":{"role":"author","seq_no":"2"},"display_name":"FRASER, SM","full_name":"FRASER, SM","wos_standard":"FRASER, SM","first_name":"SM","last_name":"FRASER"}]},"doctypes":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"doctype":"Article"},"publishers":{"publisher":{"address_spec":{"@attributes":{"addr_no":"1"},"full_address":"PUBLICATIONS DEPT, BRONX, NY 10458","city":"BRONX"},"names":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"name":{"@attributes":{"addr_no":"1","role":"publisher","seq_no":"1"},"display_name":"NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN","full_name":"NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN"}}}}},"fullrecord_metadata":{"languages":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"language":"English"},"normalized_languages":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"language":"English"},"normalized_doctypes":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"doctype":"Article"},"refs":{"@attributes":{"count":"0"}},"addresses":{"@attributes":{"count":"0"}},"category_info":{"headings":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"heading":"Science & Technology"},"subheadings":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"subheading":"Life Sciences & Biomedicine"},"subjects":{"@attributes":{"count":"3"},"subject":["Plant Sciences","Plant Sciences","PLANT SCIENCES"]}},"keywords":{"@attributes":{"count":"3"},"keyword":["RUSBY,HENRY,HURD","ECONOMIC BOTANY","PLANT EXPLORATION"]},"abstracts":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"abstract":{"abstract_text":{"@attributes":{"count":"1"},"p":"Henry Hurd Rusby (1855-1940) is one of the outstanding personalities in the history of the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG).
